## Welcome to Module 4\!

In this module, we will be applying agile contract administration practices to contract management, vendor partnerships, tracking performance, and measuring outcomes. You will get specific guidance on agile metrics. You get to work with your small group to draft a project charter and learn ways to set the tone in the contract kickoff. A tabletop breach exercise caps off the module and prepares you for unforeseen security challenges. 

## Overview & objectives

### Module summary 

Module 4 consists of exercises and insights for managing vendor partnerships and supporting delivery through contract administration practices grounded in agile and lean methodologies. You will track project health using real-time, measurable, objective indicators, support continuous delivery, and adapt to change while ensuring alignment with mission goals. 

You will get information about how to launch a digital services contract starting with the contract kickoff, moving on to ongoing contract management and problem resolution. 

Importantly, you will conduct a hands-on tabletop exercise to develop and enhance a playbook in the event of a security breach. 

The focus is on transparency, collaboration, and outcomes throughout the contract lifecycle.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Explain the role of product ownership in agile delivery and how it supports post-award success  
* Describe how product owners, CORs, and vendors collaborate using agile tools and team rituals  
* Identify agile performance metrics that go beyond compliance to measure true delivery value  
* Compare traditional and agile performance measurement methods, including QASP alternatives and real-time metrics  
* Outline strategies to launch a new digital services contract with the right people, tools, and processes in place
* Recognize early signs of delivery issues and explain approaches to address performance concerns in agile environments

### Connection to overall DITAP program

In this module, you will focus on applying Agile principles to procurement, supporting the DITAP competency areas of Agile digital service delivery management, oversight, performance measurement principles, and problem resolution. It aligns with the broader goals of the DITAP program by reinforcing the shift from traditional, process-heavy procurement toward a more adaptive, outcome-driven approach that supports digital service delivery.

This session builds on prior learning from Module 3 which focuses on acquisition strategy, preparation and evaluation , and prepares you for upcoming topics in Module 5, such as professional growth and leadership. It helps bridge the gap between theory and application by introducing how each role contributes to building a team charter, and how to conduct a tabletop exercise in case of a cloud security breach.

## Module activities
  

1. ### Activity: Who does what? Agile role round robin (45-50 minutes)

* **Purpose**: We’ll explore real-world decision-making that occurs across agile roles during delivery \- especially between federal and vendor team members. You will practice thinking critically about who owns what in agile delivery and where the role boundaries blur.   
* **Expected Outcomes**: You will be able to delineate the agile roles and responsibilities across the team.  
* **Materials Needed**:   
  * [Participant Worksheet](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/7502b1e11acfcac5453b0314ec874ba2134abc01/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-4/In-Class-Materials/Agile%20Role%20Round%20Robin%20Participant%20Guide.md)  
* **Activity**:   
  * Join your group and review the prompts you were assigned.  
  * Ask, “What should this role do in this situation?”  
  * Don’t think about getting it “right” \- experience the tensions (this is normal) and overlap and think critically about where roles overlap. 

  **Debrief:**

    * Come together to explore what the moments of tension mean. Your group can share one scenario and a key insight that resulted from the conversation. Did someone bring a new perspective that shifted your thinking about accountability?  
    * Share one scenario your group explored.  
    * What insight or surprise emerged about role clarity?  
    * What tools, agreements, or structures could reduce future confusion?

  * Then reflect on what you saw across the board:   
    * Where did responsibilities overlap?   
    * What helped you figure out who should take action?   
    * What kinds of tools or team agreements could make this clearer in your agency or with your vendors? <br>  <br>
      

    | The big takeaway here is that shared understanding, early on, prevents slowdowns later. Having clarity doesn’t mean eliminating every gray area, but it does mean deciding how you’ll navigate those areas as a team. |

2. ### Activity: Build your charter together (35-45 minutes)

* **Purpose**: To align on what success looks like, who owns what, and how you’ll work together throughout delivery.   
* **Expected Outcomes**: The group collaborates to build a simple project charter   
* **Activity:**  
  * In your small group, work together to review the scenario and fill out four sections of a simple charter:  
    * Define the mission and project success.  
    * Clarify roles and shared responsibilities.  
    * Build a communication rhythm.  
    * Set escalation and celebration plans.  
  * This is your chance to align on what success looks like, who owns what, and how you’ll work together throughout delivery.  
  * Just like in real life, you might not agree on everything at first—that’s part of the learning. The **conversations** you have will be **just as valuable** as what you write down.  
  * Use your real-life experience to shape how you collaborate.  
  * Be ready to share a key takeaway or insight from your group.

  **Discussion:** 

  * What felt easiest to align on? What took negotiation?  
  * How did your team handle areas of overlap or uncertainty?  
  * What elements of this charter could improve your next project kickoff?

  **Notes:**   
    (*next steps, takeaways, questions, etc.*)

3. ### Discussion: What behavior are you trying to incentivize \- and does your current contract structure support it?  (15 minutes)

* **Purpose**: To understand what incentives actually matter to generate the best outcomes.  
* **Expected Outcomes**: You will be equipped to identify and articulate what behaviors you want from your vendors and partners and see how the contract can influence the likelihood of success or failure.  
  **Notes:**   
  (*next steps, takeaways, questions, etc.*)

4. ### Activity: Cloud breach tabletop exercise (60-90 minutes)

* **Purpose**: Test your team’s response to a security breach scenario, using the roles and responsibilities you hold in federal agile delivery. Focus on identifying process gaps and improving response clarity when responding to a security breach.  
* **Expected Outcomes**: By the end of this activity, you will be able to use your playbook to respond to unexpected security breaches, updating the plan as necessary to address new concerns.    
* **Activity**:   
  **Step 1:**   
  * Join your group and carefully read the scenario together.   
  * What impacts might there be? Risks?   
  * How will stakeholders be affected?

  **Step 2:**
  * In your assigned role, answer the question:  
     *“What will I do in the first 6 hours after discovery?”*  
  * Collaborate on a joint action plan.   
  * Pause at times to reflect on what is working, what is unclear, and how contract language, communication protocols, and team coordination play a role in successful breach response.   
    **The goal?** Leave this room with a better playbook than when you came in.  
  * **Group discussion:** Reflect as a team on:  
    * Each role’s biggest challenge in the scenario  
    * Where coordination broke down or work well  
    * What gaps you uncovered in contract language or escalation paths  
    * What changes you would make to your team’s current breach readiness

| Note that this is:  |
| :---- |
| - A role-based simulation, not a blame game <br> - Focused on identifying process gaps and improving response clarity <br> - Inspired by disaster recovery tabletop exercises |
