## Overview & Objectives

    

### Module Summary

Module 4 consists of exercises and insights for managing vendor partnerships and supporting delivery through contract administration practices grounded in agile and lean methodologies. Learners will track project health using real-time, measurable, objective indicators, support continuous delivery, and adapt to change while ensuring alignment with mission goals. 

Participants will get information about how to launch a digital services contract starting with the contract kickoff, moving on to ongoing contract management and problem resolution. 

Importantly, participants will conduct a hands-on tabletop exercise to develop and enhance a playbook in the event of a security breach. 

The focus is on transparency, collaboration, and outcomes throughout the contract lifecycle.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

* Explain the role of product ownership in agile delivery and how it supports post-award success.  
* Describe how product owners, CORs, and vendors collaborate using agile tools and team rituals.  
* Identify agile performance metrics that go beyond compliance to measure true delivery value.  
* Compare traditional and agile performance measurement methods, including QASP alternatives and real-time metrics.  
* Outline strategies to launch a new digital services contract with the right people, tools, and processes in place.  
  Recognize early signs of delivery issues and explain approaches to address performance concerns in agile environments.

### Connection to Overall DITAP Program

This module supports the DITAP competency areas of Agile digital service delivery management, providing oversight, performance measurement principles, and problem resolution, The focus is on enabling acquisition professionals to apply Agile principles to procurement. It aligns with the broader goals of the DITAP program by reinforcing the shift from traditional, process-heavy procurement toward a more adaptive, outcome-driven approach that supports digital service delivery.

This session builds on prior learning from Module 3 which focuses on acquisition strategy, preparation and evaluation, and prepares learners for upcoming topics in Module 5, such as professional growth and leadership. It helps bridge the gap between theory and application by introducing how each role contributes to building a team charter, and how to conduct a tabletop exercise in case of a cloud security breach.

## Module Activities

   

1. ### Activity: Who Does What? Agile Role Round Robin

   Total Time Allocation: 45-60 min, in 15-20 min intervals

   #### Activity Instructions:

   * **Purpose**: Explores real-world decision-making that occurs across agile roles during delivery \- especially between federal and vendor team members. Participants practice thinking critically about who owns what in agile delivery and where the role boundaries blur.   
   * **Expected Outcomes**: Learners will be able to delineate the agile roles and responsibilities across the team.  
   * **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):   
     * [Participant Worksheet](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/adb0ba4e119e3a6a843f118aff56a4a04e3c5b6e/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-4/In-Class-Materials/Agile%20Role%20Round%20Robin%20Participant%20Guide.md)  
     * [Facilitator Guide](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/adb0ba4e119e3a6a843f118aff56a4a04e3c5b6e/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-4/In-Class-Materials/Agile%20Role%20Round%20Robin%20Facilitator%20Guide.md)  
     * Divide participants into breakout groups of 4-6 people each   
     * 2-3 agile delivery prompts per group
     * Set up rooms (in-person or virtual)  
     * Notetaker / whiteboard and markers  
   * **Instructions**:   
     * Introduce the activity:  we are going to break out into groups and spend the next 45-60 min in a role rotation activity. The idea is to understand who owns what in an agile framework.  
     * Send each group to their respective meeting spaces and assign them their 2-3 prompts.  
     * Instruct them to take and rotate roles for each exercise, and ask “What should this role do in this situation?”  
     * Don’t think about getting it “right” \- experience the tensions (this is normal) and overlap and think critically about where roles overlap.   
     * Come together for debriefing to explore what the moments of tension mean. Each group can share one scenario and a key insight that resulted from the conversation. Did someone bring a new perspective that shifted your thinking about accountability?  
       * Share one scenario your group explored  
       * What insight or surprise emerged about role clarity?  
       * What tools, agreements, or structures could reduce future confusion?  
     * The group can then reflect on what they saw across the board:   
       * Where did responsibilities overlap?   
       * What helped you figure out who should take action?   
       * What kinds of tools or team agreements could make this clearer in your agency or with your vendors? 

       

| Facilitator Themes to Look For and/or Highlight |
| :---- |
| The big takeaway here is that **shared understanding early on prevents slowdowns later**. Having clarity doesn’t mean eliminating every gray area, but it does mean deciding how you’ll navigate those areas as a team. |

2. ### Activity: Build your Charter Together

   Total Time Allocation: 35-45 min

   #### Activity Instructions:

   * **Purpose**: To align on what success looks like, who owns what, and how you’ll work together throughout delivery.   
   * **Expected Outcomes**: The group collaborates to build a simple project charter   
   * **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):  
     * Breakout spaces  
     * [Facilitation Guide: “Build Your Charter Together”](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/adb0ba4e119e3a6a843f118aff56a4a04e3c5b6e/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-4/In-Class-Materials/Activity_Digital_Service_Project_Charter.md) (includes charter template)  
   * **Instructions**:   
     * Do a simulation of building a shared charter at the start of a project  
     * Form groups of 3-4 and take on the CO, COR, and PO roles  
     * Work together to review the scenario and fill out four sections of a simple charter:  
       * Define the mission and project success  
       * Clarify roles and shared responsibilities  
       * Build a communication rhythm  
       * Set escalation and celebration plans  
     * This is your chance to align on what success looks like, who owns what, and how you’ll work together throughout delivery.  
     * Just like in real life, you might not agree on everything at first—that’s part of the learning. The **conversations** you have will be **just as valuable** as what you write down.  
     * Use your real-life experience to shape how you collaborate  
     * Be ready to share a key takeaway or insight from your group  
   * **Discussion:**   
     Invite 1–2 groups to share highlights before opening to general discussion.  
     * What felt easiest to align on? What took negotiation?  
     * How did your team handle areas of overlap or uncertainty?  
     * What elements of this charter could improve your next project kickoff?

3. ### Discussion: What behavior are *you* trying to incentivize \- and does your current contract structure support it?

   Total Time Allocation: 15 min

   #### Activity Instructions:

   * **Purpose**: to consider what contract structure and incentives encourage the desired behaviors and outcomes?  
   * **Expected Outcomes**: Learners will be able to structure their contracts with clear intention to encourage and incentivize the vendor to deliver on contract priorities.  
   * **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):   
     * None  
   * **Instructions**:   
     “What we reward is  often what we get. If we design a contract structure that rewards speed above all else, we might get fast delivery but not necessarily quality or usability. If we reward perfect documentation, we might get thorough paperwork but maybe less responsiveness to user needs.”  
     The question we’re exploring today is: What behavior do you actually want from your vendors and partners—and does your contract make that behavior likely, or does it unintentionally discourage it?  
     * **Prompts:**   
       * “What’s an example from your own work where the incentives matched the desired behavior well?”  
       * “What’s an example where the incentives worked against the intended behavior?”  
       * “If you could redesign your current contract, what’s one small change that would better align it with your goals?”  
     * Encourage participants to consider both vendor behavior and government team behavior.

4. ### Activity: Cloud Breach Tabletop Exercise

   Total Time Allocation: 60-90 min (blocks can be adjusted per available session length)

   #### Activity Instructions:

   * **Purpose**: Test your team’s response to a security breach scenario, using the roles and responsibilities you hold in federal agile delivery. Focus on identifying process gaps and improving response clarity when responding to a security breach.  
   * **Expected Outcomes**: By the end of this exercise, participants should be able to:  
     * Apply contract breach clauses in a time-sensitive, real-world context  
     * Clarify roles and escalation responsibilities across government and vendor teams  
     * Identify weaknesses in documentation, workflows, or communication paths  
     * Strengthen response readiness and documentation protocols  
   * **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):  
     * Current contract, including breach response or incident clauses  
     * Relevant agency policies (e.g., FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, CJIS)  
     * Scenarios for the groups (see slides/facilitator guide)   
     * Assign people to groups and assign breakout rooms  
     * List of roles and responsibilities (see slides/facilitator guide)  
     * Breach response worksheet (by role) (optional)  
   * **Instructions:**   
     **Opening Briefing (5 min)**  
     * Introduce participants, present scenario overview, and outline expectations.  
     * Reinforce that the purpose is collaboration, not compliance review.  
     * Break into groups; each person takes the role of CO, COR, vendor, or security SME.   
     * Walk through a simulated breach response to a given scenario.

     **Initial Role Reactions (15 min)**

     * **Prompt**: What would you do in your role in the first 6 hours?   
     * Each participant outlines their responsibilities, communications, and decision points.

     **Scenario Update (10 min)**

     * Provide **updated** breach info: The breach is confirmed and affects 1,500 user records.  
     * Prompt participants to reassess their role response.

     **Updated Actions and Coordination (15 minutes)**

     * Roles revise their actions based on updated information.  
     * Explore how escalation, documentation, or scope of response changes.  
     * Pause at times to reflect on what is working, what is unclear, and how contract language, communication protocols, and team coordination play a role in successful breach response.   
       * **The goal**? Leave this room with a better playbook than when you came in.

   **Joint Response Planning (15 min)**

     * Facilitate a group planning session.  
     * Prompt: What coordinated actions are needed across roles to respond effectively?  
     * Document cross-functional response plan and identify key decisions.

     **Debrief and Lessons Learned (15–20 minutes)**

     * **Prompt**: Where did delays, misunderstandings, or risk exposure occur?  
     * Each role’s biggest challenge in the scenario  
     * Where coordination broke down or worked well  
     * What gaps you uncovered in contract language or escalation paths  
     * What changes you would make to your team’s current breach readiness.

     **After-Action Ideas to Share with the Class to Consider:**  
       * Clarify or revise breach response clauses  
       * Identify training or documentation needs  
       * Build a follow-up checklist or SOP for future reviews
