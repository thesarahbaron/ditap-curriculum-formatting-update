# Activity: Drafting a Statement of Objectives (SOO) for Agile Services

**Duration:** 30–45 minutes  

**Format:** Live breakout activity \+ group debrief

**Learning goal:**

Participants will practice developing a draft SOO using provided scenario prompts and apply key elements: Background, Scope, Objectives, Deliverables, Performance Standards, and Constraints/Assumptions.

## Activity structure

**1\. Introduction & setup (5 minutes)**

**Facilitator says:**

"Outcome-based acquisitions often use a Statement of Objectives (SOO) instead of a Statement of Work (SOW). Today, you'll work in small groups to quickly create a SOO based on a shared scenario. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s to practice shifting your mindset from prescribing *how* to do the work to describing *what* needs to be accomplished."

**Instructions:**

* Share the SOO sections on screen or in chat.  
* Divide participants into breakout groups of 3–5.  
* Assign one person per group to take notes and report out.

**2\. Group activity in breakouts (20–25 minutes)**

**Scenario prompt:**

Your agency needs a new platform for tracking and managing stakeholder engagement across multiple programs. The current solution is outdated, with poor user experience and no mobile support. You want a cloud-based solution built iteratively using Agile methods, with a strong focus on usability, accessibility, and performance.

**Each group drafts a quick SOO including:**

* **Background:** Why the project is needed  
* **Scope:** High-level overview of the desired work  
* **Objectives:** Desired outcomes (not tasks)  
* **Deliverables:** What the contractor is expected to produce (in outcome terms)  
* **Performance standards or metrics:** How success will be measured  
* **Constraints or assumptions (optional):** Known limitations or contextual information

Participants can use this [Developing a Statement of Objectives (SOO)](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-3/In-Class-Materials/Statement%20of%20Objectives%20Template.md) template.

Encourage them to **focus on outcomes**, not prescriptive tasks.

You can share a simple SOO template via Google Docs, PDF, or screen-share if helpful.

**3\. Report out & debrief (10–15 minutes)**

**Each group shares 1–2 highlights:**

* A strong outcome-based objective  
* One performance metric they proposed  
* One thing they struggled with when writing the SOO

**Facilitator prompts discussion:**

* "What helped you shift from tasks to outcomes?"  
* "How did you define performance without over-specifying?"  
* "What would you take back to your real-world writing?"

**Optional wrap-up poll or chat prompt:**

“What's one tip you’ll use when writing your next SOO?”

### Materials & support

* **Scenario prompt** (in slides or chat)  
* **SOO section guide** (shared screen or handout)  
* **Breakout room roles**: Note-taker, presenter  
* **Optional**: Collaborative template (Google Doc or shared workspace)
