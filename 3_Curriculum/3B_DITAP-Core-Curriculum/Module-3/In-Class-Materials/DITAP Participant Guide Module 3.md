## Welcome to Module 3\!

In this module you gain expertise in effective acquisition strategy, including planning methods, associated risks, and exit strategies. You will be equipped with the tools to know that what you are buying matches your agency’s needs. You also will be able to discern whether a procurement has been successful by establishing appropriate metrics.

You will also discuss the use of market research, and how to use metrics and incentives in service of administering and awarding digital services contracts. Tools will be reviewed, and you will be able to practice building incentives to draw in contractors. 

How-to techniques for developing a solicitation come in Sprint 2, with hands-on activities that make the experience more concrete. You will also grow to understand how to shift to an outcomes-based acquisition model.

Sprint 3 provides hands-on experience with a case study exercise in designing a solicitation strategy. You will learn the important elements of running a successful evaluation process with Agile and modern evaluation methods. 

## Overview and objectives

### Module summary

In this module you will get a clear description of digital services in the 21st century, including what they are, who provides them, how they are delivered, and why they are important. 

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Explain the purpose and value of acquisition strategy planning in the federal procurement lifecycle  
* Identify how acquisition strategies vary depending on inherited contracts versus new procurements  
* Apply key pre-award activities—such as stakeholder engagement and market research—to inform strategic decisions  
* Describe the lean canvas approach and its role as a living document in agile acquisition environments  
* Recognize when and how to update the acquisition strategy based on new inputs and evolving conditions


### Connection to overall DITAP program

This module supports the DITAP competency of applying effective techniques for acquiring digital service solutions in a solicitation and acquisition strategy, focusing on understanding the market and developing a clear statement of objectives that shifts focus to outcomes-based acquisition. It aligns with the broader goals of the DITAP program by reinforcing the shift from traditional, process-heavy procurement toward a more adaptive, outcome-driven approach that supports digital service delivery.

This module focuses on understanding the market and developing a clear statement of objectives that emphasizes outcomes-based acquisition. It supports the DITAP competency of applying effective techniques for acquiring digital service solutions within solicitation and acquisition strategies. This approach reinforces the DITAP program's broader goal of shifting from traditional, process-heavy procurement to a more adaptive, outcome-driven method that facilitates digital service delivery.

This session builds on prior learning from Module 2, and prepares you for upcoming topics such digital service delivery management and assessment.  It helps bridge the gap between theory and application by introducing the Lean Canvas as a strategic planning tool and evaluating the ethical and legal impacts of artificial intelligence at your agency.
