## I. Overview & objectives

In this session, learners will analyze two data security options presented in **Milestone 3** of the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case study. Using SWOT analysis and high-level life cycle cost estimation, they will evaluate trade-offs and recommend a solution aligned with performance, risk, and agency needs. This session builds on earlier strategy decisions and strengthens learners' comfort evaluating technical constraints and affordability.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Use SWOT analysis to compare data security options  
* Apply structured thinking to life cycle cost estimation (LCCE)  
* Recommend a solution that balances security, cost, and system performance

## II. Materials & preparation

**Materials:**
* Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges Case Study Milestone 3  
* SWOT Analysis Template  
* GAO 12-Step Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE) Visual (linked in case)

**Pre-Read for Participants:**
* Read Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges Case Study Milestone 3.

## III. Session agenda & activities

**Activity:** Evaluating Data Security Solutions  
**Time:** 60 minutes  
**Purpose:** Evaluate security trade-offs using SWOT and life cycle cost analysis.

**Instructions:**
- **Frame the Task**
    - Read or summarize the Milestone goal from the case:
        - To complete this milestone, develop a life cycle cost estimate and conduct a SWOT analysis of each option provided to address the data security challenge. The goal is to determine the most effective solution that aligns with the agency's needs without compromising system performance.  
- **Warm-Up Prompt**  
    - Ask: *What do you already know about cost estimating in federal IT projects?*  
    - *What makes data security especially tricky in digital acquisitions?*
- **Small Group Work**  
    - In breakout groups, have learners:  
        * Complete a **SWOT analysis** of each option in the case  
        * Discuss key **considerations from each SWOT quadrant** (e.g., technical, user, compliance)  
        * Use the **GAO 12-step LCCE framework** as a guide to identify cost factors—no dollar estimates needed  
        * Consider cost **drivers, assumptions, and risks** for each solution
- **Share Outs x 2**  
   * Invite one group to share with another who then shares out to the full group on their behalf:
        - Their recommended solution  
        - Key trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. risk, flexibility vs. compliance)  
        - Cost insights that shaped their thinking  
- **Synthesis & Debrief**
    - Discuss as a full group:  
        * What assumptions did your team make when estimating costs?  
        * How did the SWOT and LCCE tools influence your recommendation?  
        * What would Casey’s team need to validate before moving forward?  
        * How do these security decisions influence downstream performance or vendor selection?

**Expected Outcomes:**
* Completed SWOT templates for both options  
* High-level cost factors and rationale (not dollar estimates)  
* Thoughtful solution recommendations aligned with agency context

## IV. Next steps / Follow-Up

* (Optional) Encourage learners to begin drafting a rough Statement of Objectives (SOO) for Casey’s acquisition.  
* Review the [Periodic Table of Acquisition Innovations](https://acquisitiongateway.gov/periodic-table) for preparations on SOO development, acquisition strategies, evaluation criteria, and starting to think about setting up the contract and its award.
