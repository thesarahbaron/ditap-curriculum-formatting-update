# Key Personnel vs Outcome-Based Acquisition: A Shift in Mindset for Agile Delivery

## Training module: Rethinking key personnel in outcome-based Agile contracts

**Slide 1: Title**

- Key Personnel vs. Outcome-Based Acquisition  
- Aligning Contract Structure with Agile Delivery

**Slide 2: Why This Matters**

* Traditional contracts often focus on individual resumes and named personnel  
* Agile delivery depends on adaptable, empowered teams focused on user outcomes  
* Misalignment can lead to performance risk, delays, or unnecessary contract actions

**Slide 3: Key Concepts**

* Key Personnel (KP): Named individuals contractually required for performance  
* Outcome-Based Acquisition: Contracts structured around results, not inputs  
* Agile Software Development: Emphasizes team collaboration, iteration, and user feedback

**Slide 4: Common Practice vs Agile Need**

| Aspect | Traditional KP model | Agile/Outcome-Based approach |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Focus | Individuals | Teams |
| Structure | Prescriptive | Flexible |
| Risk Strategy | Lock in resumes | Trust team capability |
| Performance Unit | Person | Team |
| Evaluation | Resumes, Certs | Team experience, delivery history |

**Slide 5: When Key Personnel Requirements Hurt**

* Slows down onboarding or team adjustments  
* Requires mods for personnel changes, even if performance is unaffected  
* Incentivizes “check-the-box” compliance over results  
* Undermines contractor’s responsibility for staffing to meet outcomes

**Slide 6: When Key Personnel May Be Appropriate**

Use KP sparingly, and only when:

* Role is critical to contract governance or stakeholder coordination  
* Transition or continuity risk is high  
* Program-level management needs to maintain direct relationships

_Examples_:

* Program Manager  
* Technical Integration Lead (across vendors)

**Slide 7: Contract Type Matters**

| Contract Type | KP Relevance |
| :---- | :---- |
| T\&M | Higher need for KP; Government bears more risk |
| FFP / Outcome-Based | Limit KP; trust contractor to staff and deliver |

**Slide 8: Recommendations**

* Shift focus from who to what (outcomes)  
* Use team-based evaluation criteria  
* Hold vendors accountable for delivery, not resumes  
* Limit KP roles to those where continuity is essential

**Slide 9: Discussion**

Ask participants:

* Have you experienced problems with rigid KP clauses?  
* What outcomes could you define in place of specifying individual qualifications?  
* How could evaluation criteria better reflect team capability?

**Slide 10: Final Takeaways**

* Agile delivery succeeds when we empower teams, not individuals  
* Over-specifying KP limits flexibility and undermines accountability  
* Use KP intentionally and sparingly, and focus evaluation on ability to deliver outcomes
