## Welcome to Module 2\!

In this module, you will take a look at your agency and gauge its maturity and readiness for a successful procurement. You’ll define a digital service need and analyze associated constraints. There are tools you can use for these tasks, including a section on leveraging artificial intelligence. Take notes\! There is a space after each section for your thoughts and ideas. 

## Overview & objectives

### Module summary 

This module will engage you in a discovery process to set the foundation for informed acquisition strategy decisions. By assessing organizational maturity, identifying key stakeholders, analyzing mission and user needs, evaluating risks, and performing market research, you will gather the data necessary to shape a successful digital service procurement.

### Learning objectives

   By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Evaluate agency readiness and capacity for digital service procurement  
* Identify and engage key stakeholders, distinguishing them from users and customers  
* Define a digital service need and determine success criteria for the project and acquisition  
* Analyze constraints that may impact acquisition outcomes  
* Apply market research strategies to assess vendor capabilities for digital services

### Connection to overall DITAP program

  This module supports the DITAP competency areas of assessing agency maturity and readiness, distinguishing stakeholders from users and customers, defining acquisition success, and doing effective market research. These skills allow you to be deliberate and strategic in gaining support from stakeholders and to use specific measures to define success. It aligns with the broader goals of the DITAP program by reinforcing the shift from traditional, process-heavy procurement toward a more adaptive, outcome-driven approach that supports digital service delivery.
