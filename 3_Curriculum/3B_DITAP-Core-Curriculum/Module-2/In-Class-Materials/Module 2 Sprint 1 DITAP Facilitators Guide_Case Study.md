## I. Overview & objectives

In this session, learners apply stakeholder mapping techniques to **Milestone 1** of the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case study. The focus is on identifying key players, analyzing their influence and concerns, and understanding how those dynamics shape acquisition planning.

This activity builds foundational awareness of how stakeholder relationships, organizational readiness, and early planning inform strategic decisions throughout the digital acquisition process.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Identify key stakeholders and assess their influence, concerns, and alignment 
* Analyze how stakeholder dynamics impact early acquisition strategy  
  Practice applying discovery tools (e.g., stakeholder mapping) to a real-world scenario  
* Build connections between stakeholder analysis and future planning steps  
* Recognize federal-specific stakeholder constraints and opportunities that differ from private sector contexts

## II. Materials & preparation

**Materials:**
* Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges Case Study: Milestone 1 (Stakeholder Analysis)  
* Slides on stakeholder research  
* Optional resources:  
  * Stakeholder Mapping Templates or Worksheets  
  * Market Research Planning Template

**Pre-Read for Participants:**
* Read Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges Case Study   
* Specifically prepare for Milestone 1: Stakeholder Analysis

## III. Session agenda & activities

**(Sprint 1\) Activity Title:** Mapping Casey’s Stakeholders  
**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Purpose:** Apply stakeholder mapping techniques to Casey’s context and identify key players, their interests, and potential areas of tension.

**Instructions:**

- **Federal Acquisition Context Setup (Add 5-10 for facilitator)**  
    - Brief overview of the typical federal acquisition stakeholder ecosystem  
    - Explanation of unique federal constraints (FAR compliance, political oversight, career vs. political appointee dynamics)
    - Context on why federal stakeholder management differs from the private sector  
- **Warm-Up Prompt:** Imagine you're in Casey’s position at the start of the CRM project. How confident do you feel—on a scale from 0 to 5—in your ability to conduct a stakeholder analysis that identifies key players, maps influence and concerns, and informs next steps?”
    - Compare answers on lower end of spectrum and higher end of spectrum, sharing learnings and surfacing points you may want to hit on during the following activity and discussion.
- **Stakeholder Mapping in Groups**: In small groups, have learners map out the key stakeholders in the case, using **Milestone 1\.** Consider providing a template for this or encourage participants to recreate the example embedded in the case study.  
- **Group Share Outs:** As each group shares their map, ask them to discuss influence, concerns, alignment, and barriers among stakeholders. Encourage learners to cite specific evidence from the case to support their analysis.  
    - Who holds formal decision-making power? Who has informal influence? Who can block or accelerate the project?
    - What are each stakeholder’s primary worries or hesitations about the CRM procurement? Are they technical, political, legal, cultural?
    - Which stakeholders are aligned with Casey’s goals? Where is there shared vision or mutual interest?
    - What dynamics (e.g., mistrust, past project failures, misaligned incentives) may make collaboration difficult?
    - What assumptions are being made? Where might conflicts arise?  
- **Debrief** as a full group:
    - What early constraints do we see in the stakeholder environment?
    - What key information is missing or unclear?
    - What would you need to learn through market research to move forward?
    - What challenges surprised you in Casey’s early work?
    - How do or would you handle tension between internal and external stakeholder demands?
    - What parallels can you draw between Casey’s environment and your own?
    - What would you want to know next if you were Casey?  
- **Closing**  
    - Return back to the scale from the beginning of class and ask for updates and new insights.  
- **Action Planning Bridge (5 minutes)**  
    - If you were Casey's advisor, what would you recommend for next steps?
