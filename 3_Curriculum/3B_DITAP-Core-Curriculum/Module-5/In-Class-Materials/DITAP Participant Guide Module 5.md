## Welcome to Module 5\!

Successful change efforts depend upon relationships and collaboration. In this module, you will learn to apply techniques for creating a culture of innovation within your sphere that enables you and others to effectively lead customers to the best solutions. Be sure to jot down your notes in the spaces provided. Think about what leading change in your organization looks like to you. We hope the discussions and exercises in this module and throughout the course inspire you to carry your learnings forward and share them with colleagues. 

## Overview & objectives
    

### Module summary 

In Sprint 1, you will gain skills in preparing for and holding “influence” conversations and learn about preparing for and processing difficult conversations. The sprint includes examples of common topics for difficult conversations, such as acquisition, knowledge of Agile, organizational culture, organizational oversight, and more.  

Sprint 2 moves into leadership of organization change and developing a culture of continuous improvement and scalable practices. You will find a step-by-step model for leading organizational change and assess your own change style.

### Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Identify your sphere of influence  
* Identify typical challenges you may encounter when working with various stakeholders in your sphere  
* Plan for influence conversations based on challenges and opportunities in your agency or current digital assignment 
* Assess your strengths and change style  
* Develop a personal plan for contributing to and promoting change within your agency and the broader government community

### Connection to overall DITAP program

This module supports the DITAP competency area(s) of advancing change as an individual and within an organization, encouraging a culture of innovation and learning by applying methods for continuous improvement and scalable practices. It aligns with the broader goals of the DITAP program by reinforcing the shift from traditional, process-heavy procurement toward a more adaptive, outcome-driven approach that supports digital service delivery.

This session builds on prior learning from Module 4, as you prepare for digital acquisition procurement in the real world. It helps bridge the gap between theory and application by introducing tools such as generative AI, applying an agile-style retrospective post-procurement and the Kotter Model for change. These help inspire and provide impetus to stay abreast of developments in the field and sharing insights within the agency.
