# Build-a-Digital-Service Workshop

**Estimated Time:** 60-90 minutes  
**Format:** Zoom breakout groups or in-person small teams  

**Materials:**  
- Virtual or physical whiteboard (e.g., Miro, MURAL, Jamboard, or Google Slides/Docs)  
- PDF or slide outlining required design criteria (shared by facilitator)  

## Activity Goals
Participants will:  
- Apply user-centered design principles to a real-world digital service challenge  
- Integrate accessibility, feedback loops, and iterative delivery  
- Make informed procurement decisions aligned with modern acquisition practices  
- Practice collaborative planning in a simulated multi-role environment (e.g., tech, user, CO)  

## Scenario Setup (5 minutes)
**Facilitator presents the following prompt to the full group:**  
You’ve been asked to create a new government digital service to help a specific user group (e.g., veterans seeking housing assistance, small businesses applying for permits, or students applying for federal aid).  

**Mission:** In small groups, sketch out a high-level concept for the service and address the following:  
- What is the core user need?  
- What does the interface/wireframe look like?  
- How will you ensure accessibility and iterative feedback?  
- What procurement considerations or contract decisions will enable this?  

**Facilitator assigns breakout groups:** 3–5 people  

## Group Working Time (30 minutes)
**Instructions for groups (facilitator posts in chat/slides):**  

**Deliverables for Each Group:**  
- Description of digital service  
- Wireframe or sketch (rough is fine!) of a user-facing interface or service flow  
- Accessibility considerations (What barriers will you address?)  
- Feedback loop (When/how will users or stakeholders provide input?)  
- Key procurement decisions (What contract features support delivery? Modular? Coaching? ATO strategy?)  

**Suggested Roles (optional):**  
- Facilitator – keeps team on track  
- Note taker/sketcher – captures wireframe and key points  
- Presenter – shares out to full group  
- CO/COR rep – advocates for procurement alignment  

**Tip:** Teams don’t need to create real visuals—stick figures and bullet points are fine if it gets the concept across.  

## Group Presentations (10–15 minutes)
Each team presents:  
- Their service concept (1–2 minutes)  
- Key design choices and how they support user needs  
- Procurement or delivery decisions (tools, contracts, phasing, feedback channels)  

**Facilitator should spotlight:**  
- Teams that integrated accessibility or modular procurement  
- Creative ways teams enabled feedback loops  
- Cross-role thinking (tech, design, acquisition, compliance)  

## Debrief & Discussion (5–10 minutes)
**Facilitator prompts full-group reflection:**  
- What stood out in how teams approached user needs?  
- What strategies did you see for managing feedback and iteration?  
- What procurement decisions helped support flexibility or continuous delivery?  
- What felt challenging or unclear in applying these concepts?  

Encourage open reflection in chat or voice. Bonus: ask COs/CORs what they'd need in a real contract to support what the teams proposed.  

## Optional Extensions
- Use a scoring rubric for peer voting or reflection (e.g., “most user-friendly,” “best accessibility plan,” “best integration of CO decisions”)  
- Ask teams to submit final slides or sketches to a shared folder or LMS  
- Invite SMEs or guest reviewers to provide light feedback or discussion points
